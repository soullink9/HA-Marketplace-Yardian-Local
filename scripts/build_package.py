"""Builds the release's zip of the integration, then checks it the way Home Assistant will read it.

Used by both release workflows and the test workflow:  python3 scripts/build_package.py
Writes dist/yardian_local.zip (and yardian_lawn_schedule.yaml next to it), and exits non-zero if check_package.py finds a problem.

The zip holds one folder, yardian_local/, so unzipping it into /config/custom_components/ gives Home Assistant
/config/custom_components/yardian_local/. Only the integration's own files go in: Python's __pycache__ folders
(left behind by running the tests) are skipped. Files are added in a fixed order with a fixed date, so the same
code always gives the same zip, byte for byte.
