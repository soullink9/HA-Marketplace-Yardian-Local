"""Checks the release's zip the way Home Assistant and the Marketplace will read it, so a zip that wouldn't install
never gets published.

Used by build_package.py (so every build checks its zip):  python3 scripts/check_package.py dist/yardian_local.zip

Installing by hand means unzipping into /config/custom_components/, and Home Assistant then loads
custom_components/<domain>/ by the domain in its manifest.json. So this checks:

1. it's a zip that opens, and every file in it is intact;
2. everything is inside one folder named after the domain (yardian_local/), with no absolute paths or "..", so
   nothing lands outside it when unzipped;
3. the folder holds __init__.py and a manifest.json whose domain is the folder's name, with the keys Home
   Assistant and the Marketplace need, and the icon the Marketplace shows (brand/icon.png);
4. the version inside matches the repository's manifest.json, so the zip is the build it claims to be;
5. it holds exactly the integration's files: none missing, and no leftovers such as __pycache__.

Exits non-zero, with every problem found, when the zip isn't fit to publish.
