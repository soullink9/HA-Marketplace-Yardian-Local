"""Checks a release tag against the integration's version, and writes the release's notes.

Used by both release workflows (.gitea/workflows/release.yml and .github/workflows/release.yml):
    python3 scripts/release_notes.py <tag> <owner/repo on GitHub> <notes file>
(the tag is v<version>, whether the release was started from the Run workflow button or by pushing a tag).
The notes always point at the public copy on GitHub, also in a release made on Gitea.

1. The tag must name the version everywhere the project carries it (VERSION_FILES below; a leading "v" and letter
   case are ignored, so v1.2.0-Beta matches 1.2.0-beta), and CHANGELOG.md must have a section for it. A mismatch
   fails the release, so a zip is never published under the wrong version.
2. The notes are short install steps (the Marketplace, or the zip by hand, with the zip's own download address),
   then that version's section of CHANGELOG.md. Links in the changelog are relative to the repository; they're
   made absolute (at the tag) so they work on the release page.

Prints, for the workflow: "prerelease=true" or "prerelease=false" (versions with a suffix, like 1.3.0-beta, are
published as pre-releases), and "title=..." (v1.3.0-beta -> "V1.3.0 Beta", v1.2.0 -> "V1.2.0").
Exits non-zero, with the reason, when the release must not go ahead.
